## 2. Startup

The startup sequence runs once at boot before the command polling loop begins. Checks execute in order; most failures send an LED error code via serial and exit after writing a log file. Error code 4 (serial port unavailable) is the exception — only a log file is produced.

### Step 0 — Logging

- **SR-01:** On startup, the device SHALL create a `logs/` directory if absent and open a timestamped log file (`logs/{DD-Mon-YYYY_HH-MM-SSam|pm}.log`). All subsequent steps SHALL write to this file.

### Step 1 — Load Settings

- **SR-02:** The device SHALL check for `config.json` in the working directory. If the file does not exist, the device SHALL exit with **error code 1**.
- **SR-03:** If `config.json` exists but cannot be parsed as valid JSON, the device SHALL exit with **error code 2**.
- **SR-04:** The device SHALL validate that all required keys are present in the loaded config:
  `device_id`, `device_secret`, `api_url`, `command_poll_url`, `upload_url`, `completed_url`, `settings_update_status_url`, `device_state_url`, `history_upload_completed_url`, `serial_port`, `serial_baud_rate`, `camera_index`, `camera_vision_width_cm`, `yolo_model_path`, `image_save_dir`, `pending_uploads_dir`, `confidence_threshold`.
  The device SHALL check all required keys are present as a bulk operation before proceeding to value validation (SR-04b). If any key is missing, the device SHALL exit with **error code 3**. Because this is a bulk check, all keys that are present (including `serial_port`, if present) are accessible at this point and SHALL be used by SR-05 for the error-code-3 LED send.
  > `device_id` and `device_secret` are operator-supplied and have no safe defaults. If either is absent or an empty string, the device SHALL exit with **error code 3** and log a message instructing the operator to populate these values in `config.json`.
- **SR-04a:** Camera vision width (cm) defines the ground distance covered by one camera frame. This value SHALL be used as the step distance — the robot moves exactly this distance after each image capture before taking the next picture, ensuring full field coverage with no gaps or overlaps.
- **SR-04b:** Only after SR-04's bulk key-presence check passes, the device SHALL validate values: `confidence_threshold` must be a float in the range `[0.0, 1.0]` and `camera_vision_width_cm` must be a strictly positive integer. If either value fails validation, the device SHALL exit with **error code 3** and log which key holds an invalid value. At this stage all config keys including `serial_port` have already been loaded, so SR-05's error-code-3 port selection always uses the configured `serial_port`.
- **SR-05:** On error codes 1–3, the device SHALL write the error log and exit. No LED command is sent — the hardware has no LED mapping for configuration errors.
- **SR-05a:** On error codes 5–7, the device SHALL send a LED command via the already-open serial port, then write the error log and exit:
  - **Error code 5** (server unreachable): send `LED:SERVER_UNREACHABLE\n`.
  - **Error code 6** (camera failed): send `LED:CAMERA_FAIL\n`.
  - **Error code 7** (YOLO model failed): no LED command is sent — the hardware has no LED mapping for model errors; log only.
- **SR-06:** Configuration values SHALL be loaded into in-memory variables for runtime use. The device SHALL create `image_save_dir` and `pending_uploads_dir` if either does not exist. If either directory cannot be created, the device SHALL log the error and exit with **error code 3**.

### Step 2 — Open Serial Port

- **SR-07:** The device SHALL open the serial port specified by `serial_port` and `serial_baud_rate`. If the port fails to open, exit with **error code 4**.
- **SR-08:** The device SHALL flush the serial input buffer, then send `PING\n` and wait up to 3 seconds for an `OK\n` response from the ESP8266. If no valid response is received, exit with **error code 4**. On successful `OK\n` response, send `LED:STARTUP_INPROGRESS\n` to indicate remaining checks are running.

### Step 3 — Verify Server Connection

- **SR-09:** The device SHALL send `GET {api_url}/devicecheck` with `device_id` and `device_secret` as URL query parameters. If the response is not HTTP 200 within 5 seconds, exit with **error code 5**. Note: all runtime requests use POST with a JSON or multipart body, except the route fetch (SR-27a) which also uses GET with query parameters.

### Step 4 — Camera Self-Test

- **SR-10:** The device SHALL open the camera at `camera_index` via OpenCV, capture one frame, verify the frame is non-empty with non-zero dimensions, then release the camera. If any step fails, exit with **error code 6**.

### Step 5 — YOLO Model Self-Test

- **SR-11:** The device SHALL load the YOLO model from `yolo_model_path` and run inference on a blank test image (`numpy.zeros((640, 640, 3))`). If the load or inference raises an exception, exit with **error code 7**.

### Step 6 — Signal Ready

- **SR-12:** On passing all checks, the device SHALL send `LED:STARTUP_OK\n` via serial followed immediately by `LED:VEHICLE_IDLE\n` to initialise the vehicle status LED, then start the command polling background thread and block the main thread until SIGINT or SIGTERM. On receiving SIGINT or SIGTERM, the device SHALL perform the following shutdown sequence in order:
  1. Set the abort flag (the same flag used by the `stop` command) to signal any active handler thread to stop.
  2. Set a separate polling-stop event to signal the polling thread to exit its loop after the current poll cycle.
  3. Send `STP\n` to the ESP8266 via serial.
  4. Send `LED:SHUTDOWN\n` to indicate the process is terminating.
  5. If an active handler thread exists, join it with a 5-second timeout.
  6. Join the polling thread with a 6-second timeout (just over the 5-second poll request timeout).
  7. Flush the serial input buffer, close the serial port, and exit.

### Error Code Summary

| Code | Stage | Cause |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Settings | `config.json` does not exist |
| 2 | Settings | `config.json` is not valid JSON |
| 3 | Settings | One or more required config keys are missing, empty, or hold an invalid value; or a required working directory could not be created |
| 4 | Serial | Port failed to open, or ESP8266 did not respond to `PING` |
| 5 | Server | `/api/devicecheck` did not return HTTP 200 within 5 s |
| 6 | Camera | Camera failed to open or returned an empty frame |
| 7 | YOLO | Model failed to load or inference threw an exception |

---

## 3. Command Polling

- **SR-13:** The device SHALL poll the web server every 2 seconds by sending a `POST` request to `command_poll_url` with a JSON body containing `device_id` and `device_secret`. The poll request SHALL time out after 5 seconds. If the server responds with HTTP 401 or a body indicating unknown device or wrong secret, the device SHALL log the authentication error and send `LED:AUTH_FAIL\n` via serial; polling SHALL continue on the next 2-second cycle.
- **SR-13a:** The device SHALL parse the server's poll response as a JSON object and act on the `command` field as follows:
  1. If the response cannot be parsed as JSON or does not contain a `command` field, the device SHALL ignore the response and resume polling.
  2. If `command` is `null`, treat as a no-op and resume polling.
  3. If `command` is a recognised value (`"start"`, `"stop"`, `"update"`, `"start_pending_upload"`, `"stop_pending_upload"`), the device SHALL process it per SR-15 and the applicable gating rules in SR-15c.
  4. If `command` is any other value, the device SHALL log a warning and treat as a no-op.
  5. If `command` is `"start"` or `"update"` but the `payload` field is absent or is not a JSON object, the device SHALL log a warning and treat as a no-op.
  6. `"stop"`, `"start_pending_upload"`, and `"stop_pending_upload"` require no payload.
- **SR-14:** Polling SHALL run in a background thread independently of any active operation. The polling loop SHALL check the polling-stop event at the start of each cycle before sending the poll request; if the event is set, the loop SHALL exit immediately without sending a new poll request.
- **SR-15:** The device SHALL handle the following commands: `start`, `stop`, `update`, `start_pending_upload`, `stop_pending_upload`.
- **SR-15a:** If a poll request fails (network error or timeout), the device SHALL log the error, send `LED:SERVER_UNREACHABLE\n` via serial, and resume polling on the next 2-second cycle. Poll failures SHALL NOT affect any in-progress operation. When a poll request returns HTTP 200 after one or more consecutive poll failures, the device SHALL send `LED:CLEAR_ERROR_LED\n` via serial before processing the response.
- **SR-15b:** No upload attempt is made during normal polling; pending files are uploaded only when a `start_pending_upload` command is received (Section 4a).
- **SR-15c:** Command gating rules by device state:
  - **Idle:** all commands are processed normally.
  - **Mode A/B/C handler active:** `start` and `start_pending_upload` SHALL be logged and ignored. `stop`, `update`, and `stop_pending_upload` SHALL be processed (`stop_pending_upload` is logged and ignored as there is no pending-upload mode to exit).
  - **History Data Upload Mode active:** the polling thread remains running but ONLY `stop_pending_upload` SHALL be processed. All other commands (`start`, `stop`, `update`, `start_pending_upload`) SHALL be logged and ignored for the duration of the mode.

---

## 4. Update Settings Command

- **SR-16:** On receiving `update`, the device SHALL validate, persist, and apply settings as specified by the payload per SR-16a and SR-17.
- **SR-16a:** The `update` payload SHALL be a JSON object. The device SHALL process it as follows:
  1. **Allowed fields:** Only `confidence_threshold` and `camera_vision_width_cm` are remotely updatable. All other fields are read-only from the web application's perspective.
  2. **Unrecognised / read-only fields:** For any field in the payload that is not `confidence_threshold` or `camera_vision_width_cm`, the device SHALL log a warning and add it to `blocked_fields` with reason `"unrecognised_field"`.
  3. **Validation:** The device SHALL validate that `confidence_threshold` is a float in `[0.0, 1.0]` and that `camera_vision_width_cm` is a strictly positive integer. If a value fails validation, the device SHALL log a warning, leave the corresponding setting unchanged, and add the field to `blocked_fields` with reason `"validation_error"`. Items 3 and 4 are evaluated in order; a field that fails validation in item 3 is not subject to the WDS check in item 4 — only one reason is recorded per field.
  4. **WDS-active guard:** If `camera_vision_width_cm` passed validation in item 3 but a WDS is in progress, the device SHALL log a warning, add `camera_vision_width_cm` to `blocked_fields` with reason `"wds_active"`, and leave the setting unchanged; the active WDS continues with the value in effect at the time it started.
  5. **Effect timing:** `confidence_threshold` updates take effect at the next YOLO inference. If a WDS is active, the updated threshold applies from the next iteration's SR-35 onward. `camera_vision_width_cm` takes effect on the next WDS call (or immediately if no WDS is active).
- **SR-17:** After SR-16a processing, the device determines two sets: `applied_fields` (passed validation and not blocked) and `blocked_fields` (failed validation or WDS-blocked). The device SHALL send a single consolidated `POST` to `settings_update_status_url` with a JSON body containing `device_id`, `device_secret`, and a `status` field determined as follows:
  - If `applied_fields` is empty: skip the file write, log the event, and send `"status": "failed"` with a `"failed"` array listing each blocked field and its reason (`"wds_active"`, `"validation_error"`, or `"unrecognised_field"`).
  - If `applied_fields` is non-empty and `blocked_fields` is non-empty: write `applied_fields` to the JSON configuration file first; on success apply them to in-memory variables and send `"status": "partial"` with an `"applied"` array and a `"failed"` array; on file-write failure leave in-memory unchanged and send `"status": "failed"` with `"reason": "disk_write_error"`.
  - If `applied_fields` is non-empty and `blocked_fields` is empty: write to the JSON configuration file first; on success apply to in-memory variables and send `"status": "success"`; on file-write failure leave in-memory unchanged and send `"status": "failed"` with `"reason": "disk_write_error"`.

  Each entry in the `"applied"` array SHALL be a string field name (e.g. `"confidence_threshold"`). Each entry in the `"failed"` array SHALL be an object with a `"field"` string (the field name) and a `"reason"` string (`"wds_active"`, `"validation_error"`, or `"unrecognised_field"`). The top-level `"reason": "disk_write_error"` is used when a file-write failure causes the entire update to fail, and no per-field `"failed"` array is included in that case.

  All notification POSTs to `settings_update_status_url` SHALL time out after 5 seconds; if the request fails or times out, the device SHALL log the error and resume polling. If `settings_update_status_url` responds with HTTP 401, the device SHALL log the authentication error, send `LED:AUTH_FAIL\n` via serial, and resume polling.

---

## 4a. History Data Upload Command

- **SR-49:** On receiving `start_pending_upload` while idle, the device SHALL:
  1. POST to `device_state_url` with `{"device_id": "<device_id>", "device_secret": "<device_secret>", "state": "pending_upload"}` (10-second timeout; not retried; failure is logged and the mode proceeds regardless).
  2. Spawn a History Data Upload handler thread (same threading pattern as Mode B/C handlers). The polling thread continues running during the upload to receive commands.
  Only `stop_pending_upload` is acted on while this mode is active (per SR-15c).
- **SR-50:** The handler SHALL process bundles in lexicographic stem order (oldest first). Each bundle is identified by a shared filename stem (`{stem}_raw.jpg`, `{stem}_annotated.jpg`, `{stem}.json`); the `job_id` and `step_index` for each upload SHALL be read from `{stem}.json`. If `{stem}.json` cannot be read or parsed, the device SHALL log an error, skip that bundle, and count it toward `failed`. The device SHALL upload each bundle as a multipart `POST` to `upload_url` with the same format as SR-38 (including `device_id`, `device_secret`, `job_id`, and `step_index` as form fields); each upload attempt SHALL time out after 30 seconds. On successful upload the device SHALL delete the three bundle files. If an upload returns HTTP 401, the device SHALL log the authentication error, send `LED:AUTH_FAIL\n` via serial, and leave the bundle in place. For all other upload failures, the device SHALL retry once after 5 seconds; during this 5-second wait the handler SHALL check the `stop_pending_upload` flag every 2 seconds — if set, the handler SHALL leave the bundle in place (counting it toward `failed`), stop processing further bundles, and proceed to SR-51. If the retry also fails (and no stop was received), the device SHALL leave the bundle in place and continue to the next bundle. The device SHALL track the count of successfully uploaded bundles (`succeeded`) and bundles left in place (`failed`). After each upload attempt completes (or times out), the handler SHALL check whether `stop_pending_upload` has been received; if so, it SHALL stop processing further bundles and proceed to SR-51.
- **SR-51:** On normal completion (all bundles processed) or early exit via `stop_pending_upload`, the device SHALL:
  1. POST to `history_upload_completed_url` with `{"device_id": "<device_id>", "device_secret": "<device_secret>", "succeeded": <count>, "failed": <count>}` (10-second timeout; not retried). If the request fails, times out, or receives a non-200/non-401 response, the device SHALL log the error. If the server responds with HTTP 401, the device SHALL log the error and send `LED:AUTH_FAIL\n` via serial.
  2. POST to `device_state_url` with `{"device_id": "<device_id>", "device_secret": "<device_secret>", "state": "idle"}` (10-second timeout; not retried; failure is logged).
  3. Send `LED:VEHICLE_IDLE\n` via serial and return to idle/polling state.
- **SR-52:** If `start_pending_upload` is received while idle but `pending_uploads_dir` contains no bundles, the device SHALL still POST the entry state (`state: "pending_upload"`) to `device_state_url`, immediately send the completion POST with `"succeeded": 0` and `"failed": 0`, then POST `state: "idle"` and return to idle.

---

## 5. Stop Command

- **SR-18:** On receiving `stop`, the device SHALL immediately abort any in-progress operation. In Mode A, `stop` SHALL abort the active movement command. In Modes B and C, `stop` SHALL abort both the active vehicle movement and the weed detection sequence. If the abort occurs mid-iteration before SR-38 (i.e. partial files from SR-34–SR-37 that have not yet been through an upload attempt), the device SHALL delete those partial files. Files that have already been handled by SR-38 (deleted on success or moved to `pending_uploads_dir` on failure) SHALL NOT be touched.
- **SR-18a:** The `stop` command is propagated to the active mode handler as follows:
  1. **Signal:** The polling thread SHALL transmit `STP\n` to the ESP8266 per SR-43, then set a shared abort flag (e.g. `threading.Event`) to notify the active handler thread.
  2. **Iteration-start check:** The WDS loop SHALL check the abort flag at the top of each iteration (before SR-34). If set, the loop SHALL abort with reason `stopped` and return to the mode handler.
  3. **Post-upload check:** The WDS loop SHALL also check the abort flag between SR-38 and SR-39. If set, no additional file handling is required — SR-38 will have already deleted or moved all iteration files before returning. The loop SHALL abort with reason `stopped`.
  4. **Retry-wait check:** During the 5-second SR-38 retry wait, the device SHALL check the abort flag every 2 seconds. If the abort flag is set during this wait, the device SHALL move all three iteration files to `pending_uploads_dir` (preserving detection data) and abort the WDS with reason `stopped`.
- **SR-19:** The device SHALL send `LED:VEHICLE_IDLE\n` via serial and return to idle/polling state after stopping. If no operation is in progress when `stop` is received, the device SHALL log the event and remain in idle/polling state. A `stop` command received during History Data Upload Mode SHALL be logged and ignored; use `stop_pending_upload` to exit that mode early.

---

## 6. Start Command — 3 Operation Modes

- **SR-20:** The `start` command payload SHALL include a `mode` field indicating the operation mode: `"A"` for Manual Control, `"B"` for One-Way Weed Detection, `"C"` for Route-Based Weed Detection. The device SHALL send `LED:VEHICLE_WORKING\n` via serial and then dispatch to the corresponding handler based on this field. An unrecognised `mode` value SHALL be logged and ignored (no LED is sent for an unrecognised mode).

### Mode A: Manual Control

> **Status: Planned — not yet implemented.**

- **SR-21:** Mode A commands SHALL be delivered as individual `start` payloads each containing `mode: "A"`, a `command` field (`"forward"`, `"backward"`, `"turn_left"`, `"turn_right"`), a `distance_cm` parameter, and for turn commands a `angle_deg` parameter.
- **SR-22:** The device SHALL transmit the corresponding UART frame to the ESP8266 and wait for a `DONE\n` response (timeout: 120 s), checking the abort flag every 2 seconds during the wait. If the abort flag is set (`STP\n` already transmitted by the polling thread per SR-18a), the device SHALL flush the serial input buffer to discard the ESP's subsequent `DONE\n`, and return to idle/polling state. On timeout, the device SHALL send `STP\n` and return to idle/polling state. If an `ERR:{code}\n` frame is received before `DONE\n`, the device SHALL log the error code and return to idle/polling state. After receiving `DONE\n` without abort, the device SHALL return to idle/polling state.
- **SR-23:** No camera capture or YOLO inference SHALL occur during manual control.

### Mode B: One-Way Weed Detection

- **SR-24:** The `start` command for this mode SHALL include parameters: `job_id` (unique identifier for this detection job assigned by the web server) and `travel_distance_cm` (total forward distance in centimetres). No `device_state_url` notification is sent at Mode B start — the server tracks job liveness via the job-creation timestamp and the final completion POST (SR-26).
- **SR-25:** The device SHALL pass `travel_distance_cm` to the Weed Detection Sequence (Section 7) as `forward_distance_cm` and `start_step_index = 0` in a single call; the WDS handles iteration internally until the full distance is covered.
- **SR-26:** On completion, the device SHALL send a `POST` request to `completed_url` with JSON body: `{"job_id": "<job_id>", "device_id": "<device_id>", "device_secret": "<device_secret>", "status": "completed", "total_distance_cm": <distance_covered>}`. If the Weed Detection Sequence aborted, the device SHALL instead send `{"job_id": "<job_id>", "device_id": "<device_id>", "device_secret": "<device_secret>", "status": "aborted", "reason": "<timeout|err|stopped>", "total_distance_cm": <distance_covered>}`. The completion POST request SHALL time out after 10 seconds. If the request fails, times out, or receives a non-200/non-401 response, the device SHALL log the error, send `LED:VEHICLE_IDLE\n` via serial, and return to idle/polling state. If the server responds with HTTP 401 or a body indicating unknown device or wrong secret, the device SHALL log the authentication error, send `LED:AUTH_FAIL\n` via serial, send `LED:VEHICLE_IDLE\n` via serial, and return to idle/polling state. The completion notification is not retried; the server must reconcile job status through other means.

### Mode C: Route-Based Weed Detection

> **Status: Planned — not yet implemented.**

- **SR-27:** The `start` command for this mode SHALL include parameters: `job_id` (unique identifier for this detection job assigned by the web server) and a `route_name` referencing a pre-saved route on the server. No `device_state_url` notification is sent at Mode C start — the server tracks job liveness via the job-creation timestamp and the final completion POST (SR-31).
- **SR-27a:** After receiving the `start` command, the device SHALL send a `GET` request to `{api_url}/route` with `route_name`, `device_id`, and `device_secret` as URL query parameters and expect a JSON response with a `"steps"` key containing the ordered list of route steps. The request SHALL time out after 5 seconds. If the request returns HTTP 401 or a body indicating unknown device or wrong secret, the device SHALL log the authentication error, send `LED:AUTH_FAIL\n` via serial, and send the `aborted` completion POST (SR-31) with reason `err`. For all other failures (network error, timeout, or non-200/non-401 response), the device SHALL log the error and send the `aborted` completion POST (SR-31) with reason `err`. If the HTTP 200 response body cannot be parsed as JSON or does not contain a valid ordered list of route steps, the device SHALL log the error and send the `aborted` completion POST (SR-31) with reason `err`. In all failure cases the aborted completion POST SHALL use `total_distance_cm: 0`, since no route steps have been executed.
- **SR-28:** A route SHALL be an ordered list of steps, each with a `type` field (`"forward"`, `"turn_left"`, or `"turn_right"`), and a `value` field (distance in cm for forward steps; angle in degrees for turn steps).
- **SR-28a:** Before iterating route steps, the device SHALL initialise `total_distance_covered = 0` and `cumulative_step_index = 0`.
- **SR-28b:** For each step in the route in order: if `type` is `"forward"`, apply SR-29; if `type` is `"turn_left"` or `"turn_right"`, apply SR-30. If a step's `type` is unrecognised, the device SHALL log a warning and skip that step.
- **SR-29:** For each forward segment in the route, the device SHALL pass the segment's distance value as `forward_distance_cm` and the current `cumulative_step_index` as `start_step_index` to the Weed Detection Sequence (Section 7). After the WDS call returns, the device SHALL accumulate the returned `distance_covered` into `total_distance_covered` and add the returned `steps_taken` count to `cumulative_step_index`, then advance to the next route step. This ensures `step_index` values are globally unique across all forward segments of the same job. If the WDS returns status `aborted`, the device SHALL accumulate the partial `distance_covered` and `steps_taken` before ceasing further route steps, and shall proceed to the aborted branch of SR-31 with the WDS's abort reason.
- **SR-30:** Turn commands SHALL be sent directly to ESP8266 via UART without weed detection: `TLT:{value:.1f}\n` for `turn_left` steps and `TRT:{value:.1f}\n` for `turn_right` steps. The device SHALL wait for `DONE\n` (timeout: 120 s), checking the abort flag every 2 seconds during the wait. On timeout, the device SHALL send `STP\n`, flush the serial input buffer to discard the ESP's subsequent `DONE\n`, log the error, and abort the route with status `aborted` and reason `timeout`. If `ERR:{code}\n` is received, the device SHALL log the error and abort the route with status `aborted` and reason `err`. If the abort flag is set during the wait (`STP\n` already transmitted by the polling thread per SR-18a), the device SHALL flush the serial input buffer to discard the incoming `DONE\n` and abort the route with status `aborted` and reason `stopped`. In all abort cases the device SHALL proceed to send the `aborted` completion POST (SR-31).
- **SR-31:** On completing all route steps, the device SHALL send a `POST` request to `completed_url` with JSON body: `{"job_id": "<job_id>", "device_id": "<device_id>", "device_secret": "<device_secret>", "status": "completed", "total_distance_cm": <total_distance_covered>}`. If any route step (WDS call or turn command) aborted, the device SHALL stop processing further route steps and instead send `{"job_id": "<job_id>", "device_id": "<device_id>", "device_secret": "<device_secret>", "status": "aborted", "reason": "<timeout|err|stopped>", "total_distance_cm": <total_distance_covered>}`. The completion POST request SHALL time out after 10 seconds. If the request fails, times out, or receives a non-200/non-401 response, the device SHALL log the error, send `LED:VEHICLE_IDLE\n` via serial, and return to idle/polling state. If the server responds with HTTP 401 or a body indicating unknown device or wrong secret, the device SHALL log the authentication error, send `LED:AUTH_FAIL\n` via serial, send `LED:VEHICLE_IDLE\n` via serial, and return to idle/polling state. The completion notification is not retried; the server must reconcile job status through other means.

## 7. Weed Detection Sequence

> Used in Mode B and Mode C forward segments only.

- **SR-32:** Before starting, the device SHALL initialise `distance_covered = 0` and `step_index = start_step_index` (where `start_step_index` is passed in by the calling mode handler; Mode B always passes `0`). The loop SHALL continue until `distance_covered >= forward_distance_cm`. Each iteration captures, detects, uploads, and then moves the robot; the move distance is computed just before the movement command as specified in SR-39.
- **SR-33:** The device SHALL repeat Steps 1–5 (SR-34 through SR-38) and SR-39 below for each iteration until `distance_covered >= forward_distance_cm`. On normal completion, the sequence SHALL return `distance_covered`, `steps_taken` (equal to `step_index − start_step_index`), and a status of `completed` to the calling mode handler. On abort (DONE timeout, `ERR:{code}\n` from ESP, camera capture failure, YOLO inference exception, disk I/O failure, or `stop` command), the sequence SHALL return the partial `distance_covered` and `steps_taken` so far together with a status of `aborted` and a reason of `timeout`, `err`, or `stopped` respectively.

All files for one iteration SHALL share a common stem: `{YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS}_{step_index}` (e.g. `2026-04-22_09-15-30_3`), giving filenames: `{stem}_raw.jpg`, `{stem}_annotated.jpg`, `{stem}.json`. This stem is used to group files into upload bundles.

| Step | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | **SR-34:** Capture a photo from the USB camera and save it to `image_save_dir` as `{stem}_raw.jpg`. If capture fails, the device SHALL log the error, delete any partial files for this iteration, abort the WDS with status `aborted` and reason `err`, and return to the mode handler. |
| 2 | **SR-35:** Run the YOLO `.pt` model on the captured image, applying the configured confidence threshold. If inference raises an exception, the device SHALL log the error, delete any partial files for this iteration, abort the WDS with status `aborted` and reason `err`, and return to the mode handler. |
| 3 | **SR-36:** Draw bounding boxes on all detected weeds and save the annotated image to `image_save_dir` as `{stem}_annotated.jpg`. If saving fails, the device SHALL log the error, delete any partial files for this iteration, abort the WDS with status `aborted` and reason `err`, and return to the mode handler. |
| 4 | **SR-37:** Create a JSON file at `image_save_dir/{stem}.json` containing: `job_id`, `step_index`, detected object coordinates, class labels, and confidence scores. If writing fails, the device SHALL log the error, delete any partial files for this iteration, abort the WDS with status `aborted` and reason `err`, and return to the mode handler. |
| 5 | **SR-38:** Upload `{stem}_raw.jpg`, `{stem}_annotated.jpg`, and `{stem}.json` as a multipart `POST` to `upload_url` including `job_id`, `device_id`, `device_secret`, and `step_index` as form fields; each upload attempt SHALL time out after 30 seconds. Delete all three local files upon successful upload. If the server responds with HTTP 401 or a body indicating unknown device or wrong secret, the device SHALL log the authentication error, send `LED:AUTH_FAIL\n` via serial, and immediately move all three files to `pending_uploads_dir` without retrying (credentials will not change between retries). For all other upload failures, the device SHALL retry once after 5 seconds; during the 5-second wait the device SHALL check the abort flag every 2 seconds — if set, the device SHALL move all three iteration files to `pending_uploads_dir` and abort the WDS with reason `stopped` (per SR-18a). If the retry also fails (and no abort occurred), the device SHALL move all three files to `pending_uploads_dir`. In all non-abort failure cases the sequence SHALL continue after moving the files. |

- **SR-39:** After Step 5 of each iteration, the device SHALL calculate the actual move distance as `move_cm = min(camera_vision_width_cm, forward_distance_cm - distance_covered)` to avoid overshooting on the final iteration. The device SHALL send `FWD:{move_cm:.1f}\n` to the ESP8266 and wait for `DONE\n` (timeout: 120 seconds), checking the abort flag every 2 seconds during the wait. If the abort flag is set while waiting, the polling thread will have already transmitted `STP\n` per SR-43 before setting the flag; the ESP will therefore send `DONE\n` (per SR-44). The WDS wait loop SHALL exit immediately, flush the serial input buffer to discard the incoming `DONE\n`, then abort the sequence and return to the mode handler with status `aborted` and reason `stopped`. If `ERR:{code}\n` is received during the wait, the device SHALL log the error code and abort the sequence, returning to the mode handler with status `aborted` and reason `err` (per SR-42). If `DONE\n` is not received within the timeout, the device SHALL send `STP\n`, flush the serial input buffer to discard the ESP's subsequent `DONE\n`, log the error, abort the sequence and return to the mode handler with status `aborted` and reason `timeout`. On receiving `DONE\n` without abort, the device SHALL update `distance_covered += move_cm` and `step_index += 1`.

## 8. ESP8266 UART Communication

- **SR-40:** The device SHALL communicate with the ESP8266 over USB serial (UART).
- **SR-41:** All frames transmitted over UART SHALL use the following format. Distance values are in centimetres; angle values are in degrees.

| Frame | Direction | Purpose | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `PING\n` | Jetson → ESP | Startup handshake — check ESP is alive | `PING\n` |
| `OK\n` | ESP → Jetson | Response to PING | `OK\n` |
| `LED:{status}\n` | Jetson → ESP | Set LED indicator state (see valid values below) | `LED:STARTUP_OK\n` |
| `FWD:{dist:.1f}\n` | Jetson → ESP | Move forward by dist cm | `FWD:45.0\n` |
| `BWD:{dist:.1f}\n` | Jetson → ESP | Move backward by dist cm | `BWD:45.0\n` |
| `TLT:{angle:.1f}\n` | Jetson → ESP | Turn left by angle degrees | `TLT:90.0\n` |
| `TRT:{angle:.1f}\n` | Jetson → ESP | Turn right by angle degrees | `TRT:90.0\n` |
| `STP\n` | Jetson → ESP | Abort current movement immediately; ESP responds with `DONE\n` | `STP\n` |
| `ACK\n` | ESP → Jetson | Command received and started | `ACK\n` |
| `DONE\n` | ESP → Jetson | Movement complete | `DONE\n` |
| `ERR:{code}\n` | ESP → Jetson | Movement failed | `ERR:1\n` |

**Valid `LED:{status}` values:**

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `LED:STARTUP_INPROGRESS\n` | Startup checks are running |
| `LED:STARTUP_OK\n` | All startup checks passed |
| `LED:SERVER_UNREACHABLE\n` | Startup failed — server did not return HTTP 200 (error code 5); or a runtime poll request failed (network error or timeout) |
| `LED:CLEAR_ERROR_LED\n` | Poll request returned HTTP 200 after one or more consecutive poll failures — clears the server unreachable error LED |
| `LED:CAMERA_FAIL\n` | Startup failed — camera failed to open or returned an empty frame (error code 6) |
| `LED:AUTH_FAIL\n` | Server rejected request — unknown device or wrong secret |
| `LED:VEHICLE_IDLE\n` | Vehicle is idle — no active job |
| `LED:VEHICLE_WORKING\n` | Vehicle is executing a job (Mode A, B, or C) |
| `LED:SHUTDOWN\n` | Device process is terminating (SIGINT/SIGTERM received) |

- **SR-42:** The Jetson Nano SHALL wait for `DONE\n` after sending each movement command, with a maximum timeout of 120 seconds; during a WDS the wait SHALL be implemented as specified in SR-39 (abort-flag-checked loop with serial flush on both abort and timeout). If the timeout expires, the device SHALL send `STP\n` and treat the operation as failed. If an `ACK\n` frame is received before `DONE\n`, the device SHALL discard it and continue waiting for `DONE\n`. If an `ERR:{code}\n` frame is received during an active WDS, the device SHALL log the error code, abort the current sequence and return to the mode handler with status `aborted` and reason `err`. Outside an active WDS, the device SHALL log the error code and handle it per the applicable context: in Mode A, return to idle/polling state; in Mode C turn commands, abort the route per SR-30.
- **SR-43:** When the Jetson Nano receives a `stop` command from the web server during an active movement, it SHALL immediately transmit `STP\n` to the ESP8266 via UART.
- **SR-44:** The ESP8266 SHALL listen for `STP\n` on UART during movement (non-blocking); on receiving it, the ESP8266 SHALL immediately set the GPIO pin LOW, stop the motor, and send `DONE\n` to the Jetson so the blocking DONE-wait exits immediately.
- **SR-45:** The ESP8266 firmware SHALL use a non-blocking timer (`Ticker` library) for movement duration and interrupt-based UART reading (`Serial` RX interrupt) so the MCU remains responsive to abort commands during active movement. Blocking `delay()` SHALL NOT be used.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

- **SR-46:** The polling loop and active operation (weed detection / movement) SHALL run concurrently using Python threading.
- **SR-47:** Once the polling thread receives a `stop` command, it SHALL set the abort flag; the active sequence SHALL respond to the abort flag and cease all abort-flag-checked wait loops within 2 seconds. In Mode A this means the movement DONE-wait exits within 2 seconds. In Modes B and C, all abort-flag-checked loops (iteration checks, DONE-waits, retry-waits) exit within 2 seconds; however, in-flight HTTP upload requests in SR-38 (up to 30 seconds each) are not interruptible and will complete or time out before the abort is processed. History Data Upload Mode (Section 4a) is interruptible via `stop_pending_upload` only; the in-flight HTTP upload request (up to 30 seconds) completes or times out before the interrupt is acted on. A regular `stop` command has no effect during History Data Upload Mode. Due to the 2-second poll interval and 5-second poll timeout, the stop command may take up to 7 seconds to be received after the user issues it on the server, and up to a further 2 seconds to propagate through the active wait loop, giving a total worst-case stop-to-abort latency of 9 seconds.
- **SR-48:** After each upload attempt, local image and JSON files SHALL be either deleted (on successful upload) or moved to `pending_uploads_dir` (on permanent failure) — files SHALL NOT be left in `image_save_dir` after Step 5 completes.
